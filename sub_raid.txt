# cds
flagellation if 5 cp
SB after flag->finisher
vanish after sectec during flag
dance on cd until SB ends

# st rotation
symbols (hold up to 10 sec for flag)
dance if symbols.remains >= 6 & sectec.cd < 10
if dance:
    coup_de_grace if fazed
    sectec at 3+ DM, or 1+ during SB
    eviscerate
else:
    rupture if pandemic
    coup_de_grace if fazed & raw symbols
    black_powder if escalating_blade.stack = 4
    eviscerate
backstab

# aoe
black powder in aoe if flawless form down
shadowstrike > backstab if flawless form down > shuriken storm

# notes
dance doesn't care about cp
hold sectec up to 2 sec for cold blood (overrides ALL cases)
rupture may expire for 6 sec at end of fight
always pair sectec with dance (do not sectec during raw symbols)
coup > sectec EVEN in the opener
guides advocate for raw symbols after cds but this is not exactly what the apl does - it will dance as soon as symbols.remains>=6 and sectec.cd<10
